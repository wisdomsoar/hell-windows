C:\> SET foo=bar

Do some operations for each files in current folder:

for %%f in (*) do (
certutil -hashfile "%%f" MD5
)

loop
set /a count = 1

:loop_label
  set /a count += 1
  ECHO %count%
  
goto loop_label

CertUtil is a pre-installed Windows utility that can be used to generate hash checksums:

certUtil -hashfile pathToFileToCheck [HashAlgorithm]
HashAlgorithm choices: MD2 MD4 MD5 SHA1 SHA256 SHA384 SHA512

So for example, the following generates an MD5 checksum for the file C:\TEMP\MyDataFile.img:

  CertUtil -hashfile C:\TEMP\MyDataFile.img MD5
To get output similar to *Nix systems you can add some PowerShell magic:

$(CertUtil -hashfile C:\TEMP\MyDataFile.img MD5)[1] -replace " ",""
